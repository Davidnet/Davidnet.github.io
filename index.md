The following notes are my crazy effort of having a place to write, to explore and to find my own little space on this huge city called the internet.

If you want to know more about me, you can find me on the following places:

- LinkedIn: [David Cardozo](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidcardozo/)

Most of time I am on open source projects, so if you want to collaborate on something, just let me know.
