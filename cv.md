## Summary

I am a Machine Learning Scientist and technologist, with a primary focus on utilizing cutting-edge technologies like Jax/Flax, Docker, Kubeflow, and TensorFlow to create impactful products that address complex challenges. I am a seasoned infrastructure architect and cloud forensics technician with expertise in GCP (Google Cloud Platform) and Azure. I specialize in deploying MLOps (Machine Learning Operations) solutions using Kubeflow. 

I am a software developer with a diverse background in software exploitation, math, information security, open-source development, and DevOps practices. I have extensive experience in these areas, and I am particularly passionate about community engagement and leadership in ML communities both in Canada and Colombia.

Additionally, I am a Google Developer Expert, Docker Captain, and Kubeflow Community member.

Currently I am working as Chief Lead Analyst for Updata in Canada.
